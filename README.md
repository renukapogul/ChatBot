ChatBot AI

A chatbot is a computer program designed to simulate conversation with human users, especially over the internet. It uses natural language processing (NLP) and artificial intelligence (AI) to understand and respond to user inputs in a way that mimics human conversation. Chatbots can be deployed on various platforms such as websites, messaging apps, and social media.
